I am senior data scientist with the [National Research Council Digital Technologies Centre](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/research-centres/digital-technologies-research-centre), where I lead NRC's Artificial Intelligence Accelerator.  As part of the NRC's [Data Analytics Centre](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/nrc-facilities/data-analytics-centre-research-facility), I deliver digital products and services  aiming to accelerate the adoption of AI in the Government of Canada. 

Before, I worked with the  [Department of National Defence (DND)](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence.html), where I became the first-ever Director of Data Science and established a data science team supporting the Chief Data Officer and the [Assistant Deputy Minister (Data, Innovation, Analytics)](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/organizational-structure/assistant-deputy-minister-data-innovation-analytics.html). I  also chaired a [NATO Specialist Team on Advanced Analytics and AI](https://www.sto.nato.int/search/Pages/activities_results.aspx?k=sas-150&s=Search%20Activities) and led several operational research projects while working with various branches of DND. I also worked for two years in the UK as an exchange scientist with [Dstl](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-science-and-technology).
